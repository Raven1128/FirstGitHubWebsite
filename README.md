# Colab Orginal Notebook

Google **Colab** (Collaboratory) is a cloud-based platform for running **Python** code and data science projects directly in your browser, without needing to install any software. It provides a free environment that includes pre-installed Python libraries, such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, making it perfect for machine learning, data analysis, and visualization projects. Colab allows you to create and share Jupyter Notebooks, and its integration with **Google Drive** and **GitHub** enables easy collaboration. You can also use it to train machine learning models with **GPU/TPU** support, all for free.

I'm using this to learn how it differs from Jupyter Notebooks if at all and amping up version control for projects as I learn how to integrate new things.
